# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help up understand your though process.

I restricted myself to around an hour. 
My initial plan is to get a working solution and then to refactor it by making improvements
Used TDD to add the tests but this could have been strengthened but because of time restrictions not 100% complete


* Todo
    * Refactor product and weighted product to use inheritance or composite for shared characteristics
    * Move test data into the TestData class for re use
    * Not happy  with the calculator being nested in the basket, should maybe be pulled out
    
* Potential Issues
    * Overlap of offers, since we can have bogof and 3 for 2 on same items
